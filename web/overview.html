<h2>Memory types</h2>
<p>NVIDIA's GPUs support various types of memory, each optimized for a particular access pattern.
The CUDA toolkit provides function for allocating memory of each type and for copying data
between the different memory types (including host/device data transfer).</p>
<h3>Host memory</h3>
<p><b>Heap memory</b> is regular pageable host memory allocated by <tt>malloc()</tt>.
CUDA supports copying data between heap memory and any type of device memory,
though performance is not optimal.</p>
<p><b>Page-locked host memory</b> is mapped into the address space of the GPU
and can be accessed directly, thus increasing bandwidth.
Moreover, some devices can also perform copies between page-locked host memory and
device memory concurrently with kernel execution.
Page-locked host memory is therefore best used as a data exchange area
for data which need to be updated frequently.</p>
<h3>Device memory</h3>
<p><b>linear device memory</b></p>
<p><b>pitched device memory</b></p>
<p><b>array</b></p>
<p><b>constant memory</b></p>
</ul>
